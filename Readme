# Welcome to the world of Relations 
## In this C project you will get all the Operations that are to be performed over the relations 

*The Operations that you can perform using this header file are listed below : -*
```c

//Represents the Zero-One Matrics of Relation R having dimension cardinalNo*cardinalNo with name 'Name'
void ZeroOneRepresentation(int cardinalNo, int R[20][20],char Name[10]);

// Takes input from the User of Relation defined from set A to A with n(A) = cardinalNo
void Store(int cardinalNo, int A[], int R[20][20]);

// Copies Matrix from A to B having dimensions size*size
void CopyMatrixAtoB(int size ,int A[20][20] , int B[20][20]);

// Returns addition under Boolean Laws
int BooleanAddition (int a, int b);

// Returns Multiplication under Boolean Laws
int BooleanMultiplication (int a, int b);

// Finds Transitive Closure of Relation R using Warshall Algorithm and Stores it in Closure
void WarshallAlgorithm(int cardinalNo, int R[20][20], int Closure[20][20]);
```

##### You can get the information about the prototype of the functions provided from Relations.h 

### How to run the code and include the header file in your project 
#### Workspace.c is the file where you have to use all the functions provided. 
#### Wherever your workspace file is make sure that Relations.c, Relations.o and Relations.h file should be in same parent folder

### Run the following command 
### gcc Workspace.c Relations.o -o Workspace 
#### You will get and executable file named Workspace 

### If you wish to change or add functions to relations.c, add them and run the follwing command before execution of above command
### gcc -c Relations.c -o Relations.o
